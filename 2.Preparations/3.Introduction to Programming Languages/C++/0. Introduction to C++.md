## Lesson 1: What is C++?

**C++ is a compiled language.**

That means:

- You write **source code** (`.cpp`)    
- A **compiler** turns it into a program your computer can run    

Think of it like:

`C++ code → Compiler → Program`

C++ is used for:

- Games 🎮
- Operating systems    
- Game engines    
- High-performance apps

## Lesson 2: Your first C++ program

Here is the most basic C++ program:

```
#include <iostream> 
 int main() {
      std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
      return 0; 
}
```


Let’s go **line by line**.

---

### 1️⃣ `#include <iostream>`

- This tells C++:  
    **“I want to use input/output tools”**
    
- `iostream` lets us use:
    
    - `std::cout` → print text
        
    - `std::cin` → read input
        

Think of it like importing tools 📦

---

### 2️⃣ `int main()`

- Every C++ program **starts running here**    
- `main` is the **entry point**    
- `int` means the program returns a number to the system    

You can think of `main()` as:

> “Start the program here.”

---

### 3️⃣ `{ ... }`

Curly braces define a **block of code**  
Everything inside runs **in order**.

---

### 4️⃣ `std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;`

- `std::cout` → output (print)
    
- `<<` → send data to output
    
- `"Hello, world!"` → text
    
- `std::endl` → new line
    

This line means:

> Print `Hello, world!` and move to the next line.

---

### 5️⃣ `return 0;`

- Ends the program    
- `0` means **“success”**    

---

## Very important rules (early habit)

- Every statement ends with `;`    
- C++ is **case-sensitive**    
- Code runs **top to bottom**
